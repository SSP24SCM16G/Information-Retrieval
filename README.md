## Abstract

This project introduces an Information Retrieval (IR) system built using Python, designed to facilitate efficient and accurate data search and retrieval from various web sources. It combines Scrapy for automated web crawling, custom indexing mechanisms, and a Flask-based API for user interactions. Advanced text processing techniques such as vector space modeling and cosine similarity are employed to enhance the relevance of search results.

### Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop a scalable IR system capable of handling extensive web data with high retrieval accuracy. The system aims to provide users with the ability to quickly query and retrieve information, catering to diverse informational needs across different domains.

### Future Directions

Moving forward, the project will focus on:
- Expanding the dataset to cover a broader range of web sources.
- Improving the efficiency of the crawler.
- Exploring enhancements in natural language processing techniques to improve the accuracy of the vector space model.
- Making user interface improvements to make the system more accessible and user-friendly.
- Continuously optimizing performance to ensure the system remains robust and responsive as it scales.
