Sewing up unfortunate holes in your favorite clothing is a cinch, so don’t toss those tattered jeans just yet! All you need is a needle and thread (and in some cases, a bit of extra fabric). We’ll show you how to thread a needle, backstitch a torn seam or small rip, and fasten a patch to a larger hole. Don’t nix it, fix it!",
