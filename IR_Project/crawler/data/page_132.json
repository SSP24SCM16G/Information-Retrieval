    "intro": "Eggs are tricky, and it can be hard to boil them without cracking the shells. When eggs are cold, they crack more easily upon exposure to hot water; they may also crack when they jumble into one another or settle at the bottom of the pot. In order to keep your eggs from breaking, you will need to handle them gently, boil them slowly, and keep a close eye on the temperature difference between the egg and the water.",
