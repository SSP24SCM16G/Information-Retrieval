    "intro": "If you’re taking a polygraph as part of a job interview, criminal case, or screening process, you may have an unpleasant factoid you’d like to avoid. If so, you’re in luck! Not only is it extremely easy to dupe these tests, but even if you don’t do a good job the results will likely still be muddy. Polygraphs have been proven to be inaccurate, so while the entire experience may be unpleasant, the results probably aren’t going to matter as much as you might think. Read on to learn how to pass a lie detector test with flying colors.",

The polygrapher may then claim to “know” that you are lying about something. This is a trick. Polygraphs have been proven to be inaccurate on their own normally, and your countermeasures 100% sealed the deal.",
