    "intro": "Gummy bears are some of the simplest candies to make at home. At their core, they are just 4 ingredients: water, sugar, gelatin, and flavoring. Water and gelatin, when blended, heated, and cooled, naturally form a chewy candy, so you don’t need any expensive equipment or odd ingredients to create homemade gummy bears. To get bear shapes, you will need gummy bear molds. ",
