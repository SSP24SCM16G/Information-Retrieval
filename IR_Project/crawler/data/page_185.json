    "intro": "Adjectives are words that describe nouns within sentences. They usually answer questions that someone might have about the noun, such as “What kind?” “How many?” and “Which one?” Because adjectives appear in a few places within a sentence, you can usually spot an adjective by checking certain places. Depending on the form of the adjective, it may also have a suffix, such as -ish, -ous or -ful, which can make it easy to identify adjectives that are not used in a sentence.",
