    "intro": "Rosemary oil is a popular infused oil used in cooking and beauty treatments. If you want to make rosemary oil quickly, heat a few sprigs of fresh rosemary in your oil of choice. However, keep in mind that this oil must be used within a week or it could go rancid. Alternatively, use dried rosemary to create an oil with a longer shelf life. Dried rosemary can be mixed with your oil of choice in a canning jar and set in a sunny place to slowly infuse into an edible oil. This method can be used with prepackaged dried rosemary or your own homemade dried rosemary.",
