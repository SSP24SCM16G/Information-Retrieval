    "article": "How to Make a Girl Who Is Really Mad at You Forgive You",
    "intro": "It’s easy to get frustrated when a girl that you care about is mad at you—especially if it feels like you don’t deserve it. Getting her to forgive you can be challenging, but try to put your ego aside and make an honest effort to get back in her good graces. Start by apologizing, and mean it. Let her share her own perspective and feelings about the situation. Then, ask her how you can make it up to her and take steps to do so.",

                    "subtitle": " If she gets mad over a comment or joke, you may initially feel she is being irrational. If she said or did something that made you act out in the first place, you may think that she has no right be mad. Don’t follow the impulse to fight back or criticize her. There will be a time and place to discuss both perspectives, but in the heat of the moment, getting angry is just going to make her upset.",
