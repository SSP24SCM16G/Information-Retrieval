    "intro": "This wikiHow article teaches you how to remove stubborn blank pages from anywhere in your Word document. Blank pages in the middle of your document are usually the result of hidden extra paragraphs or page breaks. If the blank page is at the end, it could be the same situationâ€”however, it's also may be due to Word's hidden end paragraph feature. You can get rid of blank pages by making paragraph and page breaks markers visible and editing or deleting them manually.",
