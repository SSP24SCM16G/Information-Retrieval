    "article": "How to Stop a Cat from Clawing Furniture",
    "intro": "Cats clawing on furniture and other household furnishings may be purely destructive behavior from your point of view but not from the cat's point of view. To them it's natural behavior, following a need to keep their claws in top shape and to leave visual and scent markings on the object, communicating territory boundaries to other cats and other animals. In addition, scratching provides a form of exercise for cats, stretching and retracting their shoulders, legs, and paws.",
