    "intro": "Some cicadas emerge from the ground every year, while others operate on a 13- or 17-year cycle. There’s no way to totally stop cicadas, but they don’t bite or sting, and they do minimal damage to most plants, so a little diligence and damage control is all that’s needed. That’s why we're here to give you the best tips on preventing cicada damage and getting rid of cicadas, and also give you an overview on these occasional critters, so that you know what to expect during the next cicada season.",

Then, they emerge, climb a tree, molt their exoskeleton, and become mature cicadas ready to do the whole thing over again. ",
