    "article": "How to Work Out Salary Increase Percentage",
    "intro": "Salary increases can take on many forms. You may have gotten a raise or a promotion, or you may have accepted a new, higher-paying job entirely. Regardless of circumstance, you probably want to know how to calculate your pay raise as a specific percentage of your old rate. Since inflation rates and cost of living statistics are often expressed as percentages as well, calculating an increase as a percentage can help you compare the increase to other forces like inflation. Learning how to work out a salary increase percentage will also help you to compare your compensation against others in your field.",

You’ll have a wide range of other items to factor into your increased bottom line. Some of these items include:",

                        "Insurance benefits/premiums - If both jobs offer employer-based insurance coverage, then you’ll have to compare the coverage of the insurance plans. You’ll also need to factor the premium (if applicable) taken out of your paycheck into your decision. Going from paying $100/month to $200/month in insurance premiums for the same coverage would negate some of your salary increase, for instance. Also consider the depth of the coverage (do they include dental or vision?), the overall yearly deductibles you may have to pay, etc.",
                        "Bonuses or commissions - Though not part of your standard salary, don’t forget to include bonuses and/or commissions in each calculation. The new salary might offer more each paycheck, but if your current job has the potential for quarterly bonuses, for instance, does the increase still pan out? Keep in mind that this amount may not be consistent because it will probably depend on your performance and/or the company’s performance.",
                        "Retirement plans - Most companies offer a 401k retirement plan that allows you to take pre-taxed wages and put them aside for your retirement. Many companies match up to a certain percentage of an employee’s contribution to his or her personal 401k. If your current company does not match and your new company matches up to 6%, then that’s essentially free additional money toward your retirement to consider.",
                        "Pensions - Jobs that offer pensions for certain numbers of years of continuous service also require consideration. If your current position offers a great pension after twenty-five years, but the new position doesn’t offer any type of pension, then you should consider that as well. A higher yearly salary might be more money immediately, but it’s also worth considering the lifetime earning potential of each. However, keep in mind that pensions are not the norm today. They still exist, but they do not always pay out as expected. In some cases, the funds have been mismanaged and there is little or nothing left for people to retire on."

Now say that inflation stays at a flat 0% the year you get the raise, but rises 1.6% the following year without you receiving another raise. This means it will take you an additional 1.6% to purchase the same basic goods and services. 1.6% of $50,000 is equal to 0.016 x 50,000 = $800.
