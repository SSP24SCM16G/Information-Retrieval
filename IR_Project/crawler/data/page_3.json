    "intro": "Whether you're trying to make a creative dessert or prank one of your office mates at work, suspending a solid object in Jello is a fun, easy activity. Start by mixing 1 packet of Jello into a large mixing bowl. Let the Jello set and then place the object on it. Mix up 2 more packets of Jello and pour them in. After the whole mixture sets in the refrigerator, pop it out onto a flat plate and serve!",
