    "intro": "Properly-folded boxer briefs can save precious space in your drawers or suitcase, and help you stay organized. There are a few different techniques to accomplish this. For ideal storage in a drawer, flatten the boxer briefs out. For a more stackable result, fold the underwear into a square.
