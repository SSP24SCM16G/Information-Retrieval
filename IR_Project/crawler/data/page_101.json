    "intro": "If you peer into your goldfish tank and wonder, “Why is my fish swimming sideways?” the most likely cause is swim bladder disorder. This disease is pretty common in goldfish that eat too quickly or too often. Constipation, enlarged organs, and infection can cause a fish’s swim bladder to stop functioning. That's why we're here to walk you through the process of treating your goldfish for buoyancy disorder. Plus, we'll explain how to prevent your fish from getting sick again and cover the symptoms, causes, and risk factors for swim bladder disease.",

Give it a few more days to see if the symptoms of swim bladder disorder go away. If your fish never regains the ability to swim and eat properly, contact a veterinarian or aquarium specialist."
