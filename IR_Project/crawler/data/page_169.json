    "intro": "It can be strange—and stressful—to feel high when you’re completely sober. This is especially true when you’re experiencing some of the less-than-pleasant side effects associated with a weed-related high, like a heightened heart rate, elevated anxiety, and bad coordination.",

                    "subtitle": " The high you get from smoking or vaping weed doesn’t last that long—about 1 to 3 hours, in fact, depending on how much you smoke/inhale and what your baseline tolerance is. Edibles (like cookies, brownies, gummies, troches, etc.), however, can take a lot longer to wear off. If you’re still feeling high a few hours after taking an edible, the explanation could very well be that you  still high.",

                        " Snack on a little bit of black pepper, pine nuts, or a lemon rind if there’s still THC in your body. As random as these foods may seem, they have ingredients that may help you start feeling more like yourself. Some people find that taking CBD products can help you recover from a THC high, as well as hopping into a cold shower."
