    "intro": "Powder foundation is great for giving your face a bit of a lighter coverage while still evening out your skin tone and minimizing your pores. Powder foundation sometimes gets a bad rep in the makeup community—it can look cakey, make your skin dry, or settle into lines on your face. However, it works well for people with all skin types as long as you prepare a little bit beforehand. By really patting the foundation into your skin so that it adheres to your face, you can make your skin look smooth and flawless every time.",
