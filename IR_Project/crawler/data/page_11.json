    "intro": "Developing your personality starts with understanding yourself.  Evaluate what traits you see in yourself, and what you want to improve.  Identify and focus on the positive personality traits that strengthen your confidence, openness, perseverance, kindness, and humility.  On the flipside, it's important to know what traits won't get you the results you want. Ultimately, each person's personality is their own, and there is no one way to have a happier or more attractive personality.  By understanding more about yourself, you can let your positive qualities shine through.\t",
