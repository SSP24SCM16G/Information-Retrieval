    "intro": "It can be hard to know if you're prepared and ready for a real and serious relationship. It's even harder if you just broke up with your ex, or are just starting dating. It is important to make sure you truly are ready before entering into a serious romantic relationship.",

However, when dating, particularly in teenage years, you have to be prepared with the possibility of rejection. Your date may find someone else they like, or you may lose your interest in being in a relationship. Can you appropriately  respond to rejection?

Be nice to yourself rather than making yourself feel even worse with negative criticism. Make an effort to remember all the good qualities you have. Pat yourself on the back for having the courage to be vulnerable in the first place. Then, use what you learned from this situation to improve yourself and your relationships in the future.",

Next, explain what's not working and that you want to break up. Tell the person that you are sorry to hurt him/her. Finally, respect the other person's need for space."
