    "intro": "Chopsticks are the go-to utensil for much of the world, and in many restaurants, you might not have other options. Once you learn to wrangle ‘em, though, you’ll see that they’re a sensible and surprisingly agile way to get food from point A (the plate) to point B (your mouth). Allow us to open new culinary doors as we teach you to hold and use chopsticks, how to approach certain dishes with them, and how to follow proper dining etiquette as you chow down.",

But for sashimi, or slices of fish, opt for the chops to keep your hands free of fishy smells.",
