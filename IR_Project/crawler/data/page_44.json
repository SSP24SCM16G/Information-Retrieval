    "intro": "If you’re tired of surprise roaches scurrying across your floors and up your walls, borax is a lifesaver. This natural powdery substance, also called sodium tetraborate, kills insects like roaches, and it’s easy to use. In this article, we’ll show you how to identify roach hot-spots and apply bug-busting borax or boric acid mixtures, all while keeping your pets and kids safe. Read on to get rid of roaches once and for all!",

However, moisture makes borax less effective against roaches since part of what makes borax so deadly is its ability to rapidly dehydrate insects. To keep it as potent as possible, make sure it stays dry during storage and after application.",
