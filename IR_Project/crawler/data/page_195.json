    "intro": "A compensation proposal is a letter addressed to an employer seeking a new or improved rate of pay. It can serve as the first step in negotiating a higher salary. Letters often work better than asking your boss in person because it gives him or her time to process the request without being put on the spot. Though writing a letter may seem less stressful than having a meeting, you will still have to conduct research and present it in a formal way to improve your chances of having a successful negotiation.",

                        "Also consider the company's budget. If things have been tough for a while, your boss may not be able to give you a raise even if he wanted to. If earnings have been high, however, you can take advantage of both the availability of money and your boss' good mood by asking then."
