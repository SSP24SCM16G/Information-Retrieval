    "intro": "Grammar is the system that structures a language, and every language has its own guidelines. But grammar isn’t so much about rules as it is the conventions that determine how we speak and write, and it includes things like spelling, inflecting words for different purposes, and the way words are arranged to form sentences. While it’s good to remember that languages are living things that constantly change, it’s also important to know that proper grammar is still necessary for communication. Luckily, there are plenty of resources and style guides available to help people who want to improve their grammar.",
