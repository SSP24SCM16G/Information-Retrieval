    "intro": "Poaching eggs is a healthy way to prepare eggs, since you don't need butter or oil to cook with. Poached eggs can be eaten as they are, on salads or bread or made into eggs Benedict. The perfect poached egg will have a smooth, unbroken yolk surrounded by a shiny opaque oval of egg white that sits evenly around the egg. While you may feel a little intimidated at the thought of creating such perfection, it's actually very straightforward, even without the use of a poacher. Follow these instructions to produce a poached egg able to impress any breakfast or brunch guest you're serving!",
