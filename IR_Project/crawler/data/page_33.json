    "intro": "Emotional sensitivity is healthy, but at a certain point sensitivity can end up being detrimental. Manage your strong feelings so they are your allies, rather than enemies. Over-sensitivity may lead you to assume slights that you imagined, or are not intentional. Misinterpreting constructive, everyday interactions can limit your ability to lead a happy, healthy life. ",

                    "subtitle": " Moving away from emotional over-sensitivity doesn’t mean that you should stop feeling your emotions altogether. In fact, trying to repress or deny your emotions can cause harm. Instead, your goal should be to acknowledge “unpleasant” emotions like anger, hurt, fear, and grief -- emotions that are just as necessary for emotional health as “positive” ones like joy and delight -- without letting them take over. It's important to be able to label these emotions so that you can figure out how to move forward with them.",

                        "Try giving yourself a “safe space” to express whatever you’re feeling. For example, if you’re dealing with grief over a loss, give yourself some time each day to let all your feelings out. Set a timer and then journal about your emotions, cry, talk to yourself about your feelings -- whatever you feel you need to do. Once the timer is up, allow yourself to go back to the rest of your day. You will feel better knowing you’ve honored your feelings. You’ll also keep yourself from spending all day wrapped up in a single feeling, which can be harmful. Knowing you will have your “safe space” time to express whatever you’re feeling will make it easier for you to go on with your daily responsibilities."

You might then jump to the idea that your relationship is falling apart and that you will end up living alone in your mom’s basement.
