    "intro": "A high-functioning sociopath is someone who has antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) but can hide their symptoms well. “High-functioning sociopath” isn’t a clinical term, but can help someone who hides their ASPD from others describe themselves more accurately. It can be difficult to diagnose and treat someone with ASPD because they may believe they don’t have a disorder or give inaccurate descriptions of their symptoms. If you think you or a loved one might have high-functioning ASPD, read on to learn more.",
