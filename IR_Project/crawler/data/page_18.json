    "intro": "Some punctuation rules are just really tough to remember—like whether a period goes inside or outside parentheses in a sentence. It turns out this rule is pretty straightforward once you understand the reasoning behind it. Basically, a single sentence only gets one period, and it's outside of the parentheses unless the parentheses enclose an independent sentence. Read on to learn more about using periods and other punctuation marks with parentheses—as well as when it's appropriate to use parentheses in your writing.",
