    "intro": "Wrapping gifts can be fun, but it gets tough when you’re trying to wrap a ball or other circular objects. They don’t have edges, so it’s hard to know where to fold your paper without wrinkling it or making the present look awkward and bulky. With some strategic folding and cutting, though, you can wrap up that round ball or cylinder like a pro!",
